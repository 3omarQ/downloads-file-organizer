# downloaded-files-organizer
A python script that automatically organizes downloaded files into their respective folders based on file extensions.
It uses the file system watcher "watchdog", and once a file is downloaded, the script gets triggered.
## How should you use this?
Remember to replace 'C:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads' with the actual path to your Downloads folder.  
Create 5 directories in your Downloads folder named: "Images", "Videos", "Setups", "Documents", "Compressed"  
Use your task scheduler to run the script automatically when your computer starts.
